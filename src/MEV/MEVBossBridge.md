## MEV Boss Bridge

[Boss Bridge](./diagrams/signature-front-run.svg)

- Once the signer send `s,r,v` to the mempool
- any one else can see this and front run the tx with that same signature
- To mitigate this, we add `nonce` to `s,r,v`
- now each time `nonce` will be different
- This will mitigate the signature replay attacks

- Also we shoudl have a check for the first time when the tx go through
- `msg.sender == signer` therfore mev bots can't front run this tx
