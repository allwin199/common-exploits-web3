- In the puppy raffle, when `selectWinner` is called
- This tx will be sent to the mempool
- Now MEV bot can look at the winner is
- Let's say winner is userA
- MEV bot is userB
- Since MEVB is not the winner
- Now MEV bot will front run the tx
- and call refund
- Let's say raffle had a total balance of 15 ether
- UserB paid 9 ether to enter
- since mev is calling refund
- it will get all 10 eth back
- MEV bot got all its money back
- Now `selectWinner` tx will go through
- but the winner will get way less amount.
- instead of getting 15 ether
- winner will only 5 ether which is very less
